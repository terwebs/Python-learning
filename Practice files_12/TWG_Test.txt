 The Whistling Gypsy (An Irish folk song)

Whistling Gypsy Rover
 The whistling gypsy came over the hill, 
down through the valley so shady. 
He whistled and he sang till the green woods rang ,

and he won the heart of a lady. 
 
Ref.: 
Ah dee doo, ah dee doo da day, 
ah dee doo, ah dee day-ee. 
He whistled and he sang till the green woods rang,
 
and he won the heart of a lady. 
 
2. 
She left her fathers castle gate, 
she left her own true lover. 
She left her pearls and her fine french lace
 
to follow the gypsy rover. 
 
3. 
Her father saddled up his fastest steed, 
he roamed the valley all over. 
He sought his daughter at great speed


and the whistling gypsy rover.

4. 
He came at last to a mansion fine


down by the river —Cladyﬁ. 
And there was music and there was wine
 
for the gypsy and his lady. 
 
 
5. 
He is no gypsy, father, she said,
 
but Lord of these lands all over, 
and I will stay ‚till my dying day 
with the whistling gypsy rover.
